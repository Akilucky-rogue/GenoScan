### GenomeScan: Advanced DNA Analysis Platform

<div>

`<p>``<em>`Unlocking genomic insights through advanced DNA analysis`</em>``</p>`

</div>## Overview

GenomeScan is a cutting-edge web platform designed to democratize access to advanced genomic analysis. It enables users to upload DNA sequence data, identify genetic variants, and discover potential therapeutic strategies based on detected abnormalities. By combining bioinformatics tools with AI-driven insights, GenomeScan bridges the gap between raw genetic data and actionable therapeutic knowledge.

## Features

- **DNA Sequence Upload**: Support for FASTA and VCF formats with secure handling of sensitive genetic data
- **Variant Detection**: Advanced algorithms to identify genetic variants and flag potential pathogenic mutations
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visual representation of DNA sequences and detected variants
- **Therapeutic Insights**: AI-generated suggestions for potential treatments based on detected variants
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed analysis reports with findings and recommendations
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system
- **Analysis History**: Track and review previous analyses


## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication (simulated in prototype)
- **Data Visualization**: Canvas API for DNA sequence visualization
- **File Handling**: Client-side parsing and validation for FASTA and VCF formats
