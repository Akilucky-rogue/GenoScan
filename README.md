## Advanced DNA Analysis & Therapeutic Insights Platform

GenomeScan is a cutting-edge web application that analyzes DNA sequences to detect abnormalities and suggests potential therapeutic strategies. This platform combines DNA sequence analysis, variant interpretation, and AI-driven therapeutic insights in one seamless workflow.

## 🧬 Features

- **DNA Sequence Upload**: Support for FASTA (.fasta, .fa) and VCF (.vcf) formats with secure handling of sensitive genetic data
- **File Validation**: Comprehensive validation of uploaded files for format and content
- **Sequence Visualization**: Interactive visualization of DNA sequences with highlighted abnormalities
- **Variant Detection**: Advanced algorithms to identify genetic variants and flag potential pathogenic mutations
- **Therapeutic Suggestions**: AI-driven suggestions for potential treatments based on detected variants
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system
- **Analysis History**: Track and review previous analyses
- **Detailed Reports**: Comprehensive reports with downloadable options

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Authentication**: Custom authentication (JWT-based in production)
- **Visualization**: Canvas API
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **File Handling**: Custom validation and parsing utilities

## 📋 Project Status

This project is currently in the prototype phase. The current version uses mock data for demonstration purposes. Future versions will integrate with real bioinformatics APIs and databases.
